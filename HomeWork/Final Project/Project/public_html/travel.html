                    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday reiterated her call to the international community to continue pressure on Myanmar for the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh.

                    She made the call when visiting President and CEO of International Rescue Committee (IRC) David Miliband met her at her office at the Jatiya Sangsad, reports the UNB.

                    The Prime Minister said Myanmar will have to take the Rohingyas back and the international need to keep up the pressure on it, PM’s Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim told reporters after the meeting.

                    David Miliband, a British Labour Party politician, said his team arrived here to see the condition of Rohingyas on the ground.

                    Praising Bangladesh and its government, he said opening the border to Rohingyas is a significant humanitarian gesture and it is a good signal to the international community.

                    Mentioning that the team of the International Rescue Committee is working here for Rohingyas, Miliband said they will continue their assistance and recruit 100 staff from Bangladesh.

                    He, however, suggested decongestion of Rohingya camps in Cox’s bazar.

                    Both the Prime Minister and IRC President feared that the biggest problem for Rohingyas will be possible mudslide during the upcoming monsoon.

                    Sheikh Hasina said the government is preparing a safe place in Bhasanchar in Noakhali to shift Rohingyas there.

                    She said the government is providing healthcare services to the displaced Rohingyas.

                    The Prime Minister also said local people are suffering and environment is being affected due to the influx of Rohingyas.

                    Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali and PM’s International Affairs Adviser Gowher Rizvi and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister’s Office Md Nojibur Rahman were present at the meeting.
