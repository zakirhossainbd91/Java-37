                    <h1>Plastic surgery to get ‘Angelina Jolie-like lips’ goes wrong</h1>
                    <p>
                        One photo shows Mary, who is of British descent through her father, at 20 before she underwent any operations.

She says that her old look was 'basic' and her pouty pose reveals how she says she went from 'Kylie Jenner paper clip lips' to 'Angelina Jolie'.

Her plastic surgery, which she started from the age of 20, has cost her around $150,000 (£85,700).

She said that her British father, who was a missionary, does not approve of her decision.

She said: 'I knew I wanted plastic surgery since I was about fourteen. 

'Never did I imagine I would get as much as I did but it has just become a hobby of mine; like an extreme sport.'

'Before surgery there were days I would feel insecure about some things and some days I would wake up feeling like myself - now looking back at old photos, I think I was a plain Jane.

'I didn't think I was ugly at that time but looking back I just looked very basic. I much prefer my look now and it's very good for my business - I'm sure if I had a different career I would still look basic.

'I had my first procedure when I was 20. I had breast implants put in while I was in Mexico and luckily, I survived because he ended up actually being a dentist. Very sketchy.

'I'm not trying to look like anyone, I just like tattoos and plastic surgery. The bigger, the better. I'm not even the same person. I went from Kylie Jenner paper clip lips to bigger than Angelina Jolie.

'My dad doesn't like it he was a missionary same with my grandparents and they are very conservative.'

As well as three boob jobs, Mary has also had three nose jobs, a brow lift, cheek and lip fillers, Botox and arm and flank liposuction.

She even plans on getting another boob job in August despite the fact that she has experienced some breathing problems. 

Strangers haven't always agreed with her extreme surgeries.

'I was leaving the grocery store and an old lady shook her head and said violently, "now why would you do that",' Mary said.

'I was shopping with my brother who was sitting on the bench waiting for me and this little girl runs out and says to the lady sitting beside him "mum, come look at this girl's lips! She looks like a fish".'

'I have some breathing problems other than that I'm fine. I think you have to live your life for yourself.

'Do what makes you happy but also do not make impulsive decisions and really think about how it will affect your future.'
