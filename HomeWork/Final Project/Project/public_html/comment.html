                        The number of autistic children is increasing at an alarming rate in the country. Autism, the disorder, as it is claimed is not curable but manageable to some extent. If we fail to take proper steps for limiting and managing the condition of the people with the disorder, the country will be burdened with a large number of people with impaired social and intellectual capabilities. However put, most of the autistic people are dependent on others even for daily activities, let alone productive works; thus, they become burdens on family, society and the country. So, we must take all out measures to handle the disorder by encouraging people for early intervention as well as trying to help autistic children leading a life as normal as possible. The government has massive role on the autism management protocol because the government is the only institution that controls the largest mechanism to reach the grass root level.

 that will boost autism management. First, we need to make people aware of the traits, symptoms, management and consequences of the disorder. The government must lead a substantial campaign throughout the country by broadcasting informative and inspiring ads and documents on radio, TV channels and social media. Billboards with the information and messages about autism at the centers of the cities, towns and villages will also encourage people to accept and socialize with autistic children.  The campaign will assist the parents in opting for early intervention and others in accepting autistic children which is a must for the development of the latter group. Second, the government must ensure that every school (in urban and rural areas) accepts special children and each school must have at least one special education teacher. Medical colleges should offer diploma and bachelor courses on special education to produce special education teachers. They should also arrange training sessions for special education teachers on a regular basis. Third, the government will support and monitor private special schools. To support them, they will create modern and updated curriculum for them. They will also monitor their activities through regular vigilance. Moreover, they will check their curriculum, space, environment, teaching, therapy, hygiene, fees and attitude towards the children and their parents. If any special school is found below the standard level, the government should shut that down. Fourth, the government should arrange training sessions for parents of the autistic children on a regular basis
