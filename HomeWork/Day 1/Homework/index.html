In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.6 billion as of March 2018.[1]
World population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine of 1315–17 and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million.[2] The highest population growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking to 2.06% between 1965 and 1970.[3] The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century.[3]
Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million,[4] and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135 million,[5] while deaths numbered 56 million per year and were expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.[6] The median age of the world's population was estimated to be 30.1 years in 2016.
